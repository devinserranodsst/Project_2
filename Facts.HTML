<p>  heels really became popular in 15th century Persia, where they were worn by male equestrians. According to Elizabeth Semmelhack, a curator from the Bata Shoe Museum, "When the soldier stood up in his stirrups, the heel helped to secure his stance so that he could shoot his bow and arrow more easily." Heels were intended to be an instrument of war, rather than one of seduction.
Messengers from Persia began traveling to Europe, and they brought their heels with them. European male aristocrats may not have been shooting a bow and arrow while riding a horse, but they did realize that if you wore high heels, your feet would not be covered in horse shit, or, indeed, any of the muck you might find on the grounds of a Renaissance city.  </p>
<p> Heels also made people taller. This was especially impressive because height has always been considered a sign of dominance. People who reference Henry VIII often talk about how godly he seemed, as he stood 6'2" in the 1500s. Men wanted to look taller and therefore more intimidating; high heels weren't supposed to be pretty, they were supposed to be kind of scary. If you believe Dita von Teese, who said, "Heels and red lipstick will put the fear of god into people," they're still scary.
Sixteenth-century Italian courtesans soon began adopting high heels as a kind of sexy androgynous symbol. That made sense. Courtesans, the highest class of prostitutes at the time, had access to a lot of things "respectable" women didn't. They were the only women allowed to enter libraries. Since courtesans were supposed to please men, and pretty much interacted almost exclusively with them, they were often also supposed to like male things. This included reading, smoking, drinking, and wearing heels so they towered above everyone else. </p>
